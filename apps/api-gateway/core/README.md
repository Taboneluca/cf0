# Core Package

This package contains the core functionality of the API Gateway:

- `agents/`: Agent implementations (AskAgent, AnalystAgent, BaseAgent, etc.)
- `llm/`: Language Model clients and interfaces
- `sheets/`: Spreadsheet engine implementation

This reorganization was part of Phase 8 of the AI Spreadsheet Assistant enhancement project to improve code organization and maintainability.
