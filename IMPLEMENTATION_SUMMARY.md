# Implementation Summary

We have successfully implemented all the requested optimizations and improvements:

## 1. Sheet Summary Serializer

- Created `apps/api-gateway/spreadsheet_engine/summary.py` with a `sheet_summary` function
- Implemented summary with name, dimensions, headers, sample rows, and content hash
- Added a new tool in `agents/tools.py` for agents to use the summary
- Modified `chat/router.py` to use the summary instead of the full sheet state
- Created a test to verify at least 80% token reduction

## 2. Cap Tool-Loop Iterations

- Changed default MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS from 100 to 10 in `base_agent.py`
- Added "[max-tool-iterations exceeded]" prefix to responses when limit is reached
- Maintained environment variable override option

## 3. Rate-Limiter & Retry Back-Off

- Added `agents/openai_rate.py` with tenacity-based exponential backoff retry logic
- Modified `base_agent.py` to use the new chat_completion wrapper
- Added a semaphore-based concurrency limiter in FastAPI main.py
- Limit is configurable via LLM_CONCURRENCY environment variable (default: 5)

## 4. Enforce One Batched set_cells

- Added mutating call detection and counting in the agent loop
- Enforced single mutation constraint in base_agent.py
- Updated the analyst prompt to clarify the constraint
- Added validation to return error if multiple mutations are attempted

## 5. Supabase Persistence

- Created a schema for workbooks and sheets tables
- Implemented DAO layer in supabase_store.py with:
  - Background worker for non-blocking saves
  - Functions to save and load sheets/workbooks
- Modified workbook_store.py to integrate with Supabase:
  - Added loading from Supabase on workbook access
  - Hooked save calls into Spreadsheet operations
- Created a migration script to move in-memory data to Supabase
- Added startup initialization in main.py

## Environment Variables

The implementation uses the following environment variables:
- `SUMMARY_SAMPLE_ROWS`: Number of sample rows in sheet summary (default: 5)
- `MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS`: Maximum allowed agent tool calls (default: 10)
- `LLM_CONCURRENCY`: Maximum concurrent LLM requests (default: 5)
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_KEY`: Supabase API key

## Next Steps

1. Add the environment variables to Railway & Vercel
2. Run the Supabase migration script
3. Run the tests to verify token reduction
4. Monitor performance to confirm the improvements
